<h1>Duplication Detector</h1>

<p><i>Duplication Detector</i>, created for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>  on the English Wikipedia, is a tool used to compare any two web pages to identify text which has been copied from one to the other. Either, neither, or both pages may be current or old revisions of a Wikipedia article.</p>

<p>Please supply the URLs of two websites to compare (you can also choose, using the advanced version, to upload either document from your computer). The tool supports text, HTML, and PDF documents. For other types of documents, check Google's cache for an HTML version by doing a Google search for "cache:URL". To make the tool run faster for very large documents, increase minimum number of words to 3. For source documents containing scattered numerals, you may have to check "Remove numbers" to get the best matches.</p>

<p>Duplication Detector can see article text hidden by templates like {{copyvio}}, since the text is still in the HTML page source, but cannot see text that has been removed. You need to use the URL of an old revision in this case.</p>

<p>Things to do in the future:
<ul>
<li>Caching results for repeated queries</li>
<li>Use a statistical model to rule out common phrases and proper names</li>
<li>Show side-by-side comparison of phrases in original context with original capitalization and punctuation</li>
<li>Detect copying of long phrases with minor modifications such as removed/added/modified words</li>
</ul>
</p>
